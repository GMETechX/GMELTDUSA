                        <p>A family-owned retail store in Long Island was managing their finances using spreadsheets and paper receipts. With growing sales volume and upcoming tax season, they needed a proper accounting system. The owner had purchased QuickBooks Online but was overwhelmed with the setup process and unsure how to properly categorize their retail transactions, manage inventory, and track sales tax.</p>

                        <p>Over a two-week engagement, we set up their QuickBooks Online account from scratch. We created a customized chart of accounts tailored to their retail operations, configured sales tax settings for New York State, and imported three months of historical transactions from their spreadsheets. We also set up their product catalog with basic inventory tracking and connected their bank accounts for automatic transaction feeds. Finally, we provided hands-on training sessions covering daily transaction entry, invoice creation, and how to run essential financial reports for tax preparation.</p>

                        <p>A growing HVAC repair and installation company was struggling to keep up with their bookkeeping as they scaled from 3 to 8 technicians. The owner was spending 10-15 hours per week trying to categorize expenses, reconcile multiple bank accounts and credit cards, and prepare invoices. They were falling behind on their books by 2-3 months, making it difficult to understand their true profitability and cash flow. They needed reliable, ongoing bookkeeping support so the owner could focus on running the business.</p>

                        <p>We established a monthly bookkeeping routine where we handle all transaction categorization, reconcile their three bank accounts and four credit cards, and process accounts payable and receivable. Each month, we review and categorize approximately 200-300 transactions, ensuring proper job costing for their service tickets and material purchases. We also implemented a systematic process for tracking technician expenses and vehicle costs. By the 5th of each month, we deliver a complete financial package including profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and a cash flow summary with key insights.</p>

                        <p>A busy Italian restaurant using Square for their point-of-sale system was manually entering daily sales totals into QuickBooks Desktop each night. This process was taking the manager 30-45 minutes daily and was prone to errors, particularly when handling cash, credit card, and gift card transactions. They also struggled with properly tracking sales tax and tip income. With 50-80 transactions per day across lunch and dinner service, they needed an automated solution to eliminate manual entry and improve accuracy of their financial records.</p>

                    <div class="portfolio-section">
                        <h4>What We Did</h4>
                        <p>We implemented an integration between their Square POS and QuickBooks Desktop using a third-party connector tool. We configured the integration to automatically sync daily sales summaries, breaking down revenue by category (food, beverages, retail items), payment type (cash, credit, gift cards), and properly separating sales tax and tips. We set up automatic daily imports at 2 AM, ensuring all previous day's transactions were ready for review each morning. We also created custom reports in QuickBooks to match their existing reporting needs and trained their manager on reviewing the imported data and handling any exceptions.</p>

                        <p>A small IT consulting firm with 4 consultants was creating invoices manually in Word and tracking payments in a spreadsheet. Their average collection time was 45-60 days due to inconsistent follow-up on overdue invoices. They were also losing time creating recurring monthly invoices for their managed services clients. The owner wanted to professionalize their billing process, reduce collection time, and make it easier for clients to pay them. With 15-20 invoices per month ranging from $500 to $5,000, they needed a better system.</p>

                        <h4>What We Did</h4>
                        <p>We set up QuickBooks Online and created professional invoice templates matching their branding. For their 8 managed services clients, we configured recurring monthly invoices that automatically generate and email on the 1st of each month. We enabled online payment processing through QuickBooks Payments, allowing clients to pay by ACH or credit card directly from the invoice. We also configured automatic payment reminder emails to send at 7, 14, and 21 days past due. Finally, we created a simple dashboard report so they could see all outstanding invoices and their aging at a glance, and provided training on the new invoicing workflow.</p>

                        <p>An online seller of home décor products was selling through both their Shopify website and Amazon, processing 100-150 orders monthly across both platforms. They were manually downloading sales reports from each platform and trying to piece together their overall financial picture in spreadsheets. This process was taking 4-6 hours per week, and they were struggling to accurately track inventory, calculate true profitability after marketplace fees, and understand which channel was performing better. With plans to expand to Etsy and eBay, they knew their manual process wouldn't scale.</p>

                        <p>We implemented A2X for Amazon and set up Shopify's native QuickBooks Online integration to automatically sync all sales, fees, and payouts from both platforms. Each platform's daily sales are imported as summary journal entries, properly accounting for gross sales, marketplace fees, shipping revenue, sales tax, and net payouts. We configured the integration to handle returns and refunds automatically. We also set up class tracking in QuickBooks to separate revenue and expenses by sales channel, enabling accurate profitability analysis. Additionally, we connected their inventory management to track stock levels across both platforms and created monthly P&L reports by channel.</p>

                        <p>A local youth services non-profit with an annual budget of $350,000 had recently received three new grants, each with specific restrictions on how funds could be used. Their existing QuickBooks setup didn't properly separate restricted and unrestricted funds, making grant reporting difficult and time-consuming. Their executive director was spending hours manually tracking grant expenses in spreadsheets to prepare quarterly reports for each funder. With an upcoming audit and growing concern about compliance, they needed proper fund accounting to track each grant separately while maintaining overall organizational financial statements.</p>

We set up their chart of accounts to align with non-profit accounting standards and created a new coding system for categorizing expenses to specific grants. We also migrated their current year transactions into the new structure, properly allocating six months of existing grant expenses. We created custom reports showing fund balances, expenses by fund, and grant-specific spending that matched each funder's reporting requirements. Finally, we trained their bookkeeper and executive director on the new system and provided documentation for ongoing grant tracking.</p>
